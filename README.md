# Breast Cancer Subtype Classification Based on Optimized BP Neural Network

In this project, we presented optimized backpropagation neural network models for breast cancer subtype classification based on six optimization algorithms utilizing gene expression profiles. The optimization algorithms were investigated for their potential to improve the performance of breast cancer subtype prediction tasks. They were evaluated and compared to the widely-used Glorot and random initialization in the aspect of f1-score and accuracy.
